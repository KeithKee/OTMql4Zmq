<!-- <h1>Compiled Dll History</h1> -->
<h3>Project History</h3>

<p>The compiled DLL is based on the work by 2012 Austen Conrad:<br />
(from net/Git/github.com/AustenConrad/mql4zmq/mql4zmq.c)</p>

<p>    The reason for all of this is that MetaTrader is a visual basic<br />
    application and therefore is written using the STDCALL calling<br />
    convention while ZeroMQ dll EXPORT defaults to the standard C calling<br />
    convention (CDECL). If not changed, a call to libzmq.dll from<br />
    MetaTrader will result in the trading terminal crashing.</p>

<p>    Therefore, this file generates mql4zmq.dll which wraps each call the<br />
    zmq.h exports when compiled as libzmq.dll (i.e. each function that has<br />
    ZMQ_EXPORT preceeding it) as a STDCALL instead (i.e. __stdcall via<br />
    WINAPI definition).</p>

<p>    Additionally, MetaTrader4 has limitations on datatypes and data<br />
    structures that we attempt to resolve by having the wrapping function<br />
    inputs being of a type and in a manner that will jive with MQL4.</p>

<p>    To avoid naming collisions with the original zmq.h definitions we<br />
    renamed our exported functions with 'mql4' appended to the beginning<br />
    of the name.  In the OTMql4Zmq.mqh we revert the names back to the<br />
    original to reduce confusion when writing experts.</p>

<p>The source checked in to the <tt>src/mql4zmq</tt> directory has the very simple<br />
changes needed to run against ZeroMQ 4.0.x and is from:<br />
`git clone -b MQ_610_ZMQ_4 --single-branch <a href="https://github.com/ungratefulson/mql4zmq`">https://github.com/ungratefulson/mql4zmq`</a></p>
