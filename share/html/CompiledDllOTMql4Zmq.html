<h2>Compiled Dll OTMql4Zmq</h2>

<p>These problems may be fixed now; test it add your results as comments to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1</a></p>

<p>We replaced <tt>MQL4/Libraries/OTMql4/libzmq.dll</tt> with<br />
<tt>libzmq-v100-mt-2_2_0.dll</tt> that we compiled with MSVC2010<br />
according to the original instructions. These are being tracked in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/</a></p>

<p>We tried using those same instructions to compile against v4.0.4,<br />
and sending from Mt4 works, but we still have to rewrite the glue code<br />
for the version 4 changes. We'll test v2.2.0 for a while first.</p>

<p>For an example expert for using the Compiled Dll OTMql4Zmq,<br />
