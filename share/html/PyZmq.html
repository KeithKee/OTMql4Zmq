<h2>PyZmq</h2>

<p>PyZMQ is the official Python binding for the ZeroMQ Messaging Library<br />
and can be found at <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq</a> <br />
The project's Home Page is at <a href="http://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq">http://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq</a></p>

<p>It can be used to run in Python a subscriber or publisher from outside of Mt4,<br />
to receive or send information to either the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq,<br />
or the Python OTMql4Zmq.</p>

<p>It is the basis for the scripts in the<br />
<a href="bin">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/bin</a><br />
directory of the distribution, to publish to (<tt>OTZmqPublish.py</tt>)<br />
or subscribe from <tt>OTZmqSubscribe.py</tt> the Zmq running in Mt4,<br />
either the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq, or the Python OTMql4Zmq.</p>

<p>So even if you are using the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq, you may still<br />
want a Python with PyZmq installed to run the test scripts in <tt>bin</tt>.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>You will need to have <a href="pyzmq">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq</a><br />
installed in your Python.  We have used the latest version at the time of writing,<br />
but we expect that any version will work. If you are running the Python(x,y)<br />
distribution, then <tt>pyzmq</tt> is already included.</p>

<p>If not, and you have <tt>pip</tt> installed in your Python and are connected to the<br />
Internet, you can simply run <tt>pip pyzmq</tt>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, download the Python egg:<br />
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/p/pyzmq/pyzmq-14.5.0-py2.7-win32.egg">https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/p/pyzmq/pyzmq-14.5.0-py2.7-win32.egg</a><br />
and <tt>easy_install</tt> it into your Python's site-packages directory.</p>
