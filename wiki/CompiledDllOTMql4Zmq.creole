== Compiled Dll OTMql4Zmq ==

These problems may be fixed now; test it add your results as comments to
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1

We replaced {{{MQL4/Libraries/OTMql4/libzmq.dll}}} with
{{{libzmq-v100-mt-2_2_0.dll}}} that we compiled with MSVC2010
according to the original instructions. These are being tracked in
https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/

We tried using those same instructions to compile against v4.0.4,
and sending from Mt4 works, but we still have to rewrite the glue code
for the version 4 changes. We'll test v2.2.0 for a while first.

For an example expert for using the Compiled Dll OTMql4Zmq,
