A simple test Script that doesn't do much, but it's a start.
Attach it to a chart, select the tests you want to run,
and a MessageBox will pop up to tell you if it passed or failed.
We will put each test as a boolean external input so the user
can select which tests to run.

{{{bool bAssertStrerrortEqual(int i, string u) }}}

{{{string eTestErrorMessages() }}}

{{{void OnStart() }}}

{{{void OnDeinit(const int reason) }}}
